# Sign Language Communication Using LSTM 🤖✋

Welcome to the **Sign Language Communication Using LSTM** repository! This project focuses on using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to facilitate communication through sign language. With advancements in deep learning, we aim to bridge the gap between sign language and spoken language, enhancing accessibility and communication for the hearing impaired.

## Overview 🌟

In this project, we employ LSTM networks to interpret sign language gestures. The model learns from a dataset of sign language videos, capturing the nuances of hand movements and facial expressions. By using computer vision techniques and deep learning, we create a system that translates sign language into text or speech.

## Features 🚀

- Real-time sign language recognition
- High accuracy in gesture classification
- User-friendly interface for interaction
- Visualization of results using Matplotlib
- Support for various sign languages

## Technologies Used 🛠️

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the LSTM model.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and capturing gestures.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For additional machine learning functionalities.
- **MediaPipe**: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
- **OS**: For file and directory management.
- **Clustering**: To group similar gestures.

## Installation ⚙️

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hukky-mcsc/Sign-Language-Communication-Using-LSTM.git
   cd Sign-Language-Communication-Using-LSTM
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset**:
   You can find the dataset in the `data` folder or download it from the link provided in the dataset section.

## Usage 💻

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the application and allow you to begin recognizing sign language gestures. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

## Dataset 📊

The dataset consists of videos demonstrating various sign language gestures. Each gesture is labeled for training the model. You can access the dataset in the `data` folder. If you need to download additional data, please refer to the dataset source.

## Model Training 📈

Training the LSTM model involves the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing the data**: Convert videos into frames and extract features using MediaPipe.
2. **Splitting the dataset**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Building the model**: Define the LSTM architecture.
4. **Training the model**: Fit the model to the training data and validate using the test set.

To start training, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

Monitor the training process through the logs and adjust parameters as necessary.

## Results 📊

The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy and loss. Visualize the training results using Matplotlib to understand how well the model learns over epochs.
